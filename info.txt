In this folder we have two code files. In the first file "Helm_decom_climate_model_with_bc.py", 
we have written a code for incorporating Helmholtz decomposition into the climate model. In this file
we also solve the model on normal boundary conditions. 
The other file "clim_model_with_pbc_cc_1.py" is basically the same code we wrote earlier
to simulate the climate model with periodic boundary condtions for complete coupling test case.
We have made changes in this file so that we can compare the results and see if after the Helmholtz decomposition,
we still get satisfactory results.

To print files in a separate folder do this:
outfile = File("./results/file_name.pvd")
