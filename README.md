# climate_model_with_Helmholtz_decomposition

We solve the climate model equations here. We have taken no-slip boundary conditions for atm and ocean velocities. For temperature we assume insulated boundary conditions. 
We have used Helmholtz decomposition theorem to extract the solenoidal (div-free) component of atmospheric velocity. This component is then supplied to the ocean model.
